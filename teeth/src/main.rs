//! Break one rule, name the test that must notice.
//!
//! ⛔ **A test that cannot FAIL proves nothing.** Two of `pad`'s first order probes were inert
//! when written and nobody noticed until the runner was taught to check. This is that check: each
//! entry breaks ONE rule and names the test that must catch it.
//!
//! # Why this is Rust and not a shell script
//!
//! The shell version's every defect came from the shell, and each one produced a **green result
//! over work that never happened**:
//!
//! * the table was a list of bash double-quoted strings, so a raw `"` inside a pattern ended its
//!   row early and word-split the remainder into separate arguments. A 183-row sweep silently ran
//!   **106** and still printed `0 holes`. ⟹ Here the table is a typed array of [`Mutation`] and a
//!   stray quote is a **compile error**.
//! * the verdict came from grepping `cargo test`'s log. An aborted test binary truncates that log
//!   at a point decided by thread scheduling, so the *same* mutation classified as `caught` in one
//!   run and `WRONG TEST` in the next. ⟹ Here the verdict is the **exit code of one named test**,
//!   run alone. Nothing is parsed to decide anything.
//! * a mutation whose source did not compile went red and read as covered. ⟹ Here compilation is
//!   a separate step with its own outcome.
//! * a `kill -9` skipped the restore trap and left a mutated file looking like ordinary
//!   uncommitted work. ⟹ Here the restore is a [`Drop`] guard, and a repair pass runs at startup
//!   for the run that was killed before its own guard could fire.
